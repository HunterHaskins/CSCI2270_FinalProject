Project1
Summary:
For my final project I will create a small puzzle game. In the game I will use a hash table to keep track of all the current data. The object of the game is to fill the board(places in the hash table) with x's when they all start with o's. When the game starts there will be a 5x5 grid of o's. Then the game will prompt the user for the row and coloumb they which to select. The selected spot with then change to an x, and it will also change all adjacent spots with x's as well. The game will continue unti the user says quit or until the game has been completed and all of the spots on the board are x's. Then the game will prompt the user to play again or to quit.

How to run:
running this code requires that the user inter a choice of row coloumb or quitting, then it will display the results of the users choice
Dependencies:
No third party libraries will be used for this project
